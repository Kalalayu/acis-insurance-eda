End-to-end insurance risk analytics &amp; predictive modeling for AlphaCare
This task focuses on implementing Data Version Control (DVC) to ensure a reproducible, auditable, and traceable data workflow.
DVC is essential in regulated industries such as finance and insurance, where every dataset and experiment must be fully reproducible.
This repository contains an end-to-end analytics workflow for risk segmentation, exploratory analysis, and early-stage predictive modeling for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS).
The project supports the business goal of identifying low-risk customer segments and improving premium optimization using historical insurance claim data from South Africa (2014–2015).
