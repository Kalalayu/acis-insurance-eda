Task 4: Predictive Modeling & Risk-Based Premiums

Objective: Build and evaluate models to predict insurance claim severity and probability, forming the foundation for a dynamic, risk-based pricing system.

Key Steps:

Data Preparation: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and split data into training and test sets.

Modeling: Implement Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for regression (claim severity) and classification (claim probability).

Evaluation: Assess models using RMSE, R² for regression, and accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1-score for classification.

Interpretability: Use SHAP to identify the most influential features and understand their impact on predictions.

Outcome: Provides actionable insights for premium optimization and risk-based customer segmentation.

Deliverables:

Trained predictive models

Evaluation metrics and comparison

Feature importance visualizations (SHAP bar & summary plots)
